'''
Create a Python program that explores polymorphism using a hierarchy of shapes. Start with a base class Shape, and then create two or more derived classes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) that inherit from the Shape class. Each shape class should have its own implementation of methods like area() and perimeter(). These methods will calculate the area and perimeter of the respective shape.
1.
Define the Shape base class with methods like area() and perimeter(). You can initialize any common attributes in the base class.
2.
Create derived classes for different shapes, e.g., Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Each derived class should inherit from the Shape base class and implement its own version of the area() and perimeter() methods.
3.
Implement specific methods for each derived class. For example, the Circle class might have a method to calculate its area based on the radius, and the Rectangle class could have a method to calculate its area based on length and width.
Create instances of each shape type and demonstrate the use of polymorphism by calling the area() and perimeter() methods on them.
